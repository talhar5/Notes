### Polymorphism: 
- Static Polymorphism: Overloading
- Dynamic Polymorphism: Overriding
- To override a method in a derived class, it must be declared in the base class as an abstract or virtual method.
- Overloading does not happen on changing the return type, because if the program does not consume the returned value, the compiler would be confused about which method to call.
- Abstract method can only be in an abstract class.
- An abstract class can contain abstract methods and non-abstract methods.

### Abstract Class:
- Cannot be used to create classes.

### Interface: (another way to achieve abstraction)
- Interface can only contain signatures of the methods and properties.
- The keyword 'override' is not used while overriding methods of interfaces.
- All the methods are abstract and public in an abstract class.
